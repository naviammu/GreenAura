Vine types are the most popular among farmers and consumers as well. Pole bean varieties grow continuously and need supports (stakes) to grow upright. Pods are bigger in size and light in color. Bush beans doesn’t produce much yield and pods are dark green. Its normally cultivate as an intermediate crop between two main cropping seasonsSeed requirement\nVine type – 50kg/ha\nBush type- 75kg/haLand preparation\nPlough soils to make fine tilth and prepare beds which can accommodate three rows. Mark planting holes in recommended spacing.\nPlanting\nSoak seeds for about 24 hrs. before planting. Plant about 3-4 seeds per planting hole fairly away from each other. Keep beds well-watered. Two weeks after germination, keep two healthy seeding per planting hole and remove the other seedlings.Water supply\nMaintaining soil moisture at the optimum level during flowering and fruiting stages will assure higher yield. Therefore, supplementary irrigation has to be provided if the rainfall is insufficient.\nWeed Control\nKeep the cultivation weed free to reduce pests, diseases and competition of plants and weeds for nutrient and space."

They thrive in tropical climates and are rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. Almost all parts of the plant, including pods, leaves, flowers, and roots, are edible.\nSeed Requirement:\nRequires 8-10 kg of seeds per hectare.\nSeeds have a hard coat and need pre-soaking in water for 24 hours or scarification to improve germination.\nLand Preparation:\nChoose well-drained, fertile loamy soil with a pH of 5.5–7.0.\nPlow the field 2-3 times to make the soil loose and well-aerated.\nIncorporate organic manure or compost for better soil fertility.\nPlanting:\nSow seeds in rows with a spacing of 50-60 cm between rows and 30-40 cm between plants.\nUse trellising or staking for better growth and higher yields.\nBest planting time is at the beginning of the rainy season.\nWater Supply:\nRequires moderate but consistent watering, especially during the germination and flowering stages.\nAvoid waterlogging, as it can cause root rot.\nWeed Control:\nPerform regular hand weeding or mulching to suppress weed growth.\nUse shallow hoeing to avoid damaging roots.\nOrganic or chemical weed control methods can be used as needed."

It thrives in warm, humid climates and is commonly cultivated in both dryland and water-based systems. The plant is rich in vitamins A and C, iron, and fiber.\nSeed Requirement:\nRequires 8-10 kg of seeds per hectare for direct sowing.\nSeeds should be soaked in water for 12-24 hours before planting to improve germination.\nLand Preparation:\nPrefers moist, well-drained loamy or sandy soil with a pH of 5.5–7.5.\nFor dryland cultivation, plow the soil 2-3 times and add organic manure.\nFor water-based cultivation, ensure a shallow water level and good water flow.\nPlanting:\nSow seeds directly in the soil or propagate using stem cuttings.\nMaintain spacing of 20-30 cm between rows and 10-15 cm between plants.\nCan be grown year-round but prefers warm and humid conditions.\nWater Supply:\nRequires frequent watering, especially in dryland cultivation.\nKeep the soil moist but not waterlogged for healthy growth.\nIn water-based cultivation, maintain a water depth of 5-10 cm.\nWeed Control:\nPerform manual weeding or use mulching to suppress weed growth.\nIn water-based cultivation, weeds can be controlled by adjusting water levels.\nRegular harvesting helps reduce weed competition naturally."

Ginger is widely used in cooking, medicine, and as a flavoring agent in beverages.\nSeed Requirement:\nRequires 1,500–2,000 kg of rhizomes per hectare.\nSelect disease-free, healthy rhizomes with 1-2 buds for planting.\nLand Preparation:\nPrefers well-drained loamy or sandy soil with a pH of 5.5–6.5.\nPlow the land 2-3 times and add well-decomposed organic manure.\nRaised beds or ridges help prevent waterlogging and promote healthy growth.\nPlanting:\nPlant rhizomes 5-7 cm deep, with a spacing of 30 cm between rows and 20-25 cm between plants.\nThe best planting season is early spring or pre-monsoon (March–June).\nWater Supply:\nRequires regular irrigation, especially during the vegetative stage.\nAvoid waterlogging, as excess moisture can cause rhizome rot.\nReduce watering gradually as the crop matures to improve rhizome quality.\nWeed Control:\nPerform manual weeding at regular intervals.\nUse mulching with dry leaves or straw to suppress weed growth and retain moisture.\nOrganic or chemical weed control can be applied if necessary."

It thrives in warm, tropical to subtropical climates and requires well-drained soil for optimal growth. Avocado trees can live for decades and produce fruit for many years.\nSeed Requirement:\nPropagation is done using seeds, grafting, or air layering.\nGrafted trees bear fruit earlier (3-5 years) than seed-grown trees (5-10 years).\nSpacing: 8-10 meters apart to allow proper canopy development.\nLand Preparation:\nRequires well-drained loamy or sandy soil with a pH of 5.5–7.0.\nPlow the land 2-3 times and mix in organic manure or compost.\nDig pits of 60 cm × 60 cm × 60 cm and leave them open for 2-3 weeks before planting.\nPlanting:\nThe best planting time is at the beginning of the rainy season.\nPlace seedlings or grafted plants in prepared pits and cover with soil.\nWater immediately and apply mulch to retain moisture.\nWater Supply:\nRequires regular watering, especially during dry periods and fruit development.\nAvoid waterlogging, as avocado roots are prone to rot.\nDrip irrigation is recommended for better moisture management.\nWeed Control:\nPerform manual weeding around the base of the plant regularly.\nUse organic mulching (dry leaves, straw, or grass) to suppress weeds and retain soil moisture.\nLight hoeing helps aerate the soil and control weed growth."

        "Description": "Description:\nSarana spinach (Boerhavia diffusa), also known as Punarnava, is a nutritious leafy green vegetable commonly grown in tropical and subtropical regions. It is valued for its medicinal properties and thrives in warm, well-drained soils.\nSeed Requirement:\nRequires 3–4 kg of seeds per hectare.\nSeeds should be soaked in water for 12–24 hours before sowing to improve germination.\nCan also be propagated through stem cuttings for faster growth.\nLand Preparation:\nPrefers well-drained loamy or sandy soil with a pH of 5.5–7.5.\nPlow the land 2–3 times and mix in organic manure or compost.\nCreate raised beds or rows, leaving 20–30 cm spacing between them for proper air circulation.\nPlanting:\nBest planted at the beginning of the rainy season.\nSow seeds directly in the soil at a depth of 1–2 cm with 20–30 cm spacing between plants.\nWater immediately after planting and apply mulch to retain soil moisture.\nWater Supply:\nRequires regular watering, especially during the germination and growth stages.\nKeep the soil moist but avoid waterlogging.\nDrip irrigation is beneficial for maintaining consistent moisture levels.\nWeed Control:\nPerform manual weeding regularly around the plants.\nUse organic mulching (dry leaves, straw, or grass clippings) to suppress weeds and retain moisture.\nLight hoeing helps aerate the soil and prevent excessive weed growth."
